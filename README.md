# Collection of random stuff

* [Wiki](https://github.com/burrt/debian/wiki) for a list of pages on various languages and notes
* `/languages` contains some trivial functions e.g. searches, sorts etc.
* `/linux` contains basically useless dotfiles
* `debian` was named after my first distro I tried :)

**Updated wiki has been moved to [compsci-docs](https://burrt.github.io/compsci-docs/).**
