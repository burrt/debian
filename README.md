# Collection of random stuff

* [Wiki](https://github.com/burrt/debian/wiki) for a list of pages on various languages and notes
  * **Updated wiki has been moved to [compsci-docs](https://burrt.github.io/compsci-docs/)**
* `/linux` contains some misc stuff
* `debian` was named after my first distro I tried :)

## Other Repositories

I've moved most of the folders into their own repositories:

* [Dotfiles](https://github.com/burrt/dotfiles)
* [Computer Science Fundamentals](https://github.com/burrt/cs-fundamentals)
* [Computer Science Notes](https://github.com/burrt/compsci-docs)
