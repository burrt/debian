## Graph theory - city and libraries

See [the hackerrank link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/torque-and-development/problem) for the full description.

I added the time conversion function here since it was so trivial.

Files:
* `input0.txt`, `output0.txt`: the default test case they give you
* `input.txt`, `output.txt`: some harder ones

### Rant

* I forgot about the case where **cities can have no roads!!**
    * That is why they give you the number of cities and number of roads...
* I actually paid hackos for one case because I was stuck on the above... so bad
* A lot of their test cases used **very large numbers** - hence why my initial dumbass solutions had timeouts, not cool
