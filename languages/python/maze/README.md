# Maze

Currently implmented the following maze generation alorithms:
* Depth-first backtracking
* Modified PRIM's

Currently implemented the following path search algorithms:
* Depth-first
* Breadth-first
* Uniform Cost or Dijkstra's
* Greedy
* A* (manhattan)

Future:
* 4+ direction movement
* Additional heuritics
* Circular mazes

Run:
```
python3 maze -h
```
