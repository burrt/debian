Installed programs

  /bin
  /usr/bin
  /usr/share     

# you can find most executables under /bin or /usr/bin, 
# and the support files are installed in /usr/share.
  

  /usr/local 

# is a place to install files built by the administrator, usually by using the make command. 
# The idea is to avoid clashes with files that are part of the operating systems that would either be 
# overwritten or overwrite the local ones otherwise. 
# eg. /usr/bin/foo is part of the OS while /usr/local/bin/foo is a local alternative,

  /opt 

# is a directory to install unbundled packages each in their own subdirectory. 
# They are already built whole packages provided by an independent third party software distributor. 
# For example someapp would be installed in /opt/someapp, one of its command would be 
# in /opt/someapp/bin/foo 
# [and then usually a symbolic link is made in one of the bin directories in the PATH, 
# or the program is called from a desktop file (see below)].

  .desktop files

# To find out where a specific program is installed, you can do a number of steps.
# First you need to locate its .desktop file. 
# Desktop files are simular to shortcuts in Windows, and for system applications 
# they are located in /usr/share/applications. 
# The desktop files for applications that are only available for the current user 
# are in ~/.local/share/applications. 

  Take for example Google Chrome:

# which has the desktop file /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop and 
# look for the line that starts with Exec= 
# this determines how to start Google Chrome. It says:

$ cat ../google-chrome.desktop | grep Exec
  ...
  Exec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome

So you know Google Chrome is in /opt
